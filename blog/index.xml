This post is an introductory post and is Part 1 of an n-Part series on Dynamic Complexity, where n is unknown.
Since October this year, I have been working with Prof. Samir Datta on the topic of Dynamic Complexity. We are working on several problems in this subject, which I would like to write about sometime in the near future. So I guess it is only fair that I give an overview of the subject. It would be useful but not necessary to have a grasp of basic logic, circuit complexity and descriptive complexity. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep this as intuitive and simple as I can. At the same time I will also loosely state the relevant formal definitions. The presentation is geared towards an audience of CS undergraduates. Others who wish to get a quick introduction might also find this useful. I&amp;rsquo;ll revisit the basic definitions in logic and descriptive complexity for the sake of clarity. The presentation is not suitable for someone who seeks a rigorous formal introduction. Such introductions have been written in several papers and dissertations, in particular Thomas Zeume&amp;rsquo;s thesis on Small Dynamic Complexity Classes. I find it pointless to rehash them.</description>

      <description>I welcome you to this blog. This is going to be an extremely short post. I have been trying to start a blog for a while and have finally found the time to set it up. Through this blog I hope to share interesting ideas, algorithms, problems and proofs that I come across in CS theory. I am also using this blog as an exercise to constantly improve my ability to communicate complex ideas lucidly. I hope you enjoy it</description>
