      <title>Markdown for Math - Part 1</title>

      <description>I am back after a ten month hiatus. While I am keen on continuing my Dynamic Complexity series, in this two post series, I wish to write on a topic of broader interest to people working in mathematical disciplines: The use of markdown for typesetting. This subject is fairly large so I split it into two parts. In part-1, I do not go into math and diagrams, so readers who are expecting math would be disappointed. I&amp;rsquo;ve got you covered in part 2. I think, and I hope you will agree, that it is only fair that I give an introduction to markdown to those who may not have heard of it.
To those who are new to markdown, I welcome you to a beautiful and simple language that will save you tonnes of time, if you invest a very small chunk of it learning markdown. In particular, if you are a student or professor who has to typeset mathematical lecture notes, problem sheets, or even blogs, you will find this useful. Many mathematicians, physicists, and computer scientists do use it in their blogs. This post is for those who haven&amp;rsquo;t discovered markdown yet.
Why Markdown? $\LaTeX$ is an indispensable tool in the mathematical sciences for writing documents containing mathematical notation.</description>

This post is an introductory post and is Part 1 of an n-Part series on Dynamic Complexity, where n is unknown.
Since October this year, I have been working with Prof. Samir Datta on the topic of Dynamic Complexity. We are working on several problems in this subject, which I would like to write about sometime in the near future. So I guess it is only fair that I give an overview of the subject. It would be useful but not necessary to have a grasp of basic logic, circuit complexity and descriptive complexity. I&amp;rsquo;ll keep this as intuitive and simple as I can. At the same time I will also loosely state the relevant formal definitions. The presentation is geared towards an audience of CS undergraduates. Others who wish to get a quick introduction might also find this useful. I&amp;rsquo;ll revisit the basic definitions in logic and descriptive complexity for the sake of clarity. The presentation is not suitable for someone who seeks a rigorous formal introduction. Such introductions have been written in several papers and dissertations, in particular Thomas Zeume&amp;rsquo;s thesis on Small Dynamic Complexity Classes. I find it pointless to rehash them.</description>

      <description>I welcome you to this blog. This is going to be an extremely short post. I have been trying to start a blog for a while and have finally found the time to set it up. Through this blog I hope to share interesting ideas, algorithms, problems and proofs that I come across in CS theory. I am also using this blog as an exercise to constantly improve my ability to communicate complex ideas lucidly. I hope you enjoy it</description>
